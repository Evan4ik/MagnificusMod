# Magnificus Mod

Adds an entirely new Magnificus Act, selectable in the menu!<br />
The act features dungeon crawler-style gameplay, and battles that use the life counters instead of scales.<br />
This mod also features kaycee support, with mod challenge points that don't depend on your act 1 challenge points! Note: You need to **unlock** challenges in this mod, only 3 of them are available from the start.<br />
You can view your deck in the pause menu.<br />

### Notes

Playing the regular mod instead of the Kaycee Version is reccomended for first time players<br />
Bugs are to be expected! Please report them to me in the discord server.<br />
Feedback and bug reports are always welcome <3

## Known Issues

-Help! All I see is magnificus' finale scene and him standing on a pillar!<br />
This is a strange issue, but the solution is to enter act 2 and start a new run. We have no clue why.<br />
-Bell doesnt appear! This issue also appears in Grimora Mod, to fix this, you have to install the UnlockAll Mod.<br />
